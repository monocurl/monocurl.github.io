<p>While the previous was interesting, it's very susceptible to make mistakes. In particular, there are two thngs that may cause problems. The fact that animations are separated from creation time and execution time, and the fact that there's many variables. In particular, some variables are for computation and some are for on screen.</p>
<h2>5.1 The problem</h2>
<p>In particular, let's look at why this might be confusing:</p>
<h2>5.2 The solution</h2>
<p>I'll present a model and paradigm which does pretty good at avoiding these issues. It's not like you have to use this model, but I think that if you don't, it can get confusing very quickly.</p>
<p>The idea with the iterator-follower model is to have separate variables for those to be used on screen and those to be used for intermediate computations. The iterator cycles through the different discrete "states", whereas the follower is meant to be on screen, and after the iterator finishes cycling, the follower does its job by continously going through the same states as before. This might seem redundant, but i think it really does help break down really complex scenes, and provide a sense of continuinity.</p>
<h2>5.3 Toy Example</h2>
<p>Lets look at a VERY rough example of what is meant.</p>
<p>let it1 = 0
let it2 = 0
let it3 = 0</p>
<p>play += ...
play += ...
play += ...</p>
<h2>5.4 A Better Way to do Things</h2>
<p>Ok, this illustrates the idea clearly. It's very clear what the role of different stuff are. At the same time, this is a really bad way to write Monocurl code. Lets rewrite this to a manner that's more comfortable.</p>
<p>var it = 0
play +=</p>
<p>it = 0
play += </p>
<p>play += ...</p>
<p>This is better, and more likely how you write monocurl code. Admiteddly, Monocurl is still definitely too verbose. I have some ideas on how to fix it. However, the good news is that I think these are all problems that can easily be fixed by a language feature if done right. </p>
<p>We'll now look at more advanced versions of interpolation.</p></div>
