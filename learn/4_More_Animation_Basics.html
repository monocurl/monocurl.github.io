Examples of Animations</h1>
<h2>4.1 Animation Syntax</h2>
<p>Animations are typically called as functors as well. However, there is one thing that's a little new about them. You'll notice they generally take a reference. The reason is because variables are animated, not values. This might seem a little weird at first, but it actually helps keep a better sense of identity. Also, the variables we animate must be "vars" not constants. This makes sense</p>
<h2>4.2 Visibility of Meshes</h2>
<p>Lets first take a small step back and talk about the process of understanding how meshes are shown. The idea is that variables are shown. You can think of each variable as having a flag of whether it is shown or not. This brings us to our first animation. We can use the Show animation to mark a variable as being shown. Again, it's really important to notice that in the line all we're doing is adding the instruction, the actual work happens after the side. Similarly, we can also hide. Another good one to know is Wait. Also, you can show multiple variables at the same time!</p>
<h2>4.3 More complex Show and Hide</h2>
<p>Now, we can finally understand a bit more about what was happening when we showed the meshes!
There are some more intricate ways we can do the showing and hiding as well. For example, fades, writes, and stuff. We can do some pretty basic animations now. Remember, we can use sticky as well to affect how things are done in paralell.</p>
<h2>4.4 Indication Animatoins</h2>
<p>Also, some indication stuff.</p>
<h2>4.5 Modification of Meshes</h2>
<p>Important point. All modifications on screen should be done through animations. Updating the variable during hte initialization is not recommended and generally wont even work. Having a uniform source of updates leads to better code, albeit at the expense of more verbosity at times. </p>
<h2>4.6 Become Transformations</h2>
<p>That's all cool and all, but not the deal of monocurl. Monocurl is about transforming through different states, lets first talk about Become. Become can be used to change something on screen (i.e. it becomes the target)</p>
<p>That's really rough, thought. We can also use transform to do a more continous transformation. And with that, we can honestly start to make some pretty cool animatinos. </p>
<h2>4.7 Scene Variable Animations</h2>
<p>Something else that's cool is that we can do some animations on scene variables, in particular, the camera and background. We'll explore more of these in the future.</p>
<h2>4.8 Conclusion</h2>
<p>Honestly, we're pretty close to being able to do cool things. However, theres really only two more things to understand to become proficient at Monocurl, the iterator-follower model, and more work on interpolation. </p></div>
