The Iterator-Follower Paradigm</h1>
<p>While delayed execution has its benefits, you can make mistakes very easily. In this section, we'll introduce a way of thinking to eliminate these issues.</p>
<h2>5.1 The problem</h2>
<p>In particular, let's look at why delayed execution can become confusing. Suppose that Monocurl had a Shift animation that shifts the given variable tree upon execution (the standard library does not provide such an animation, we are speaking hypothetically). Then, consider this snippet</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">var mesh = Circle:
    center: ORIGIN
    radius: 1
    tag: {}
    stroke: BLACK

play += Show:
    mesh&amp;: mesh
    sticky: 0

/* over 1 second, shift the given mesh to {1, 0, 0} */
play += Shift:
    mesh&amp;: mesh
    delta: {1, 0, 0}
    time: 1
    sticky: 0

let target = Shifted:
    mesh: mesh
    delta: {0, 1, 0}

play += Transform:
    mesh&amp;: mesh
    target: target
    null_action: fade
    time: 1
    sticky: 0
</code></pre>
<p>Lets look at what the person who wrote this <em>thought</em> it would do. First we create a circle at the origin and show it. Then we shift it one unit right (so its center is at <code class="language-swift">{1,0,0}</code>). Then, we shift it one unit up (so its center is at <code class="language-swift">{1,1,0}</code>). </p>
<p>However, here's the actual output.</p>
<video controls>
    Bad iterator follower example
    <source src="/video/it_follow_bad.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

<p>While the first transition was what expected, the second one went to <code class="language-swift">{0,1,0}</code> instead of <code class="language-swift">{1,1,0}</code>. What's happening? The heart of it is the delayed execution. When we say the following line</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">play += Shift:
    mesh&amp;: mesh
    delta: {1, 0, 0}
    time: 1
    sticky: 0
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that all we are doing is merely adding an instruction to play, and nothing happens to <code class="language-swift">mesh</code> until the execution period (after the slide initialization period). Therefore, when we encouter this line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">let target = Shifted:
    mesh: mesh
    delta: {0, 1, 0}
</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-swift">mesh</code> still has not been translated, and thus we are referencing the original, untranslated mesh that sits at the origin. Thus, target has its center at <code class="language-swift">{0,1,0} + {0,0,0}</code> which is just <code class="language-swift">{0,1,0}</code>. Finally, the final transform moves the mesh to <code class="language-swift">target</code>, which sits at <code class="language-swift">{0,1,0}</code> as we just saw. Take a minute to make sure you understand what happened.</p>
<p>Therefore, the full animation first moves the mesh from the origin to <code class="language-swift">{1,0,0}</code> in the shift, and then to <code class="language-swift">{0,1,0}</code> in the transform. This is exactly what we saw in the video, and explains the behavior.</p>
<h2>5.2 The solution</h2>
<p>This sucks a lot! Thankfully there is a style of coding that makes this issue pretty easy to avoid. I call it the iterator-follower (IF) paradigm.</p>
<p>The core of the issue from above is that we use the same variable on screen as we do for making the calculations. All the IF paradigm states is that we should use two different variables for these different purposes. In particular, the iterator is used for calculations, whereas the follower is used on screen.</p>
<p>More formally, we can think about it in the following manner. During initialization, the iterator cycles through the different key "states" whereas the follower remains stagnant. During execution, the follower then moves through the same states as a result of the animations we programmed, but now the iterator is stagnant since it isn't a part of any animations.</p>

</video>

<p>Here's how we can fix the above code, and hopefully gives a better example of what we mean.</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">var iterator = Circle:
    center: ORIGIN
    radius: 1
    tag: {}
    stroke: BLACK

var follower = iterator

play += Show:
    mesh&amp;: follower
    sticky: 0

iterator = Shifted:
    mesh: iterator
    delta: {1, 0, 0}

play += Transform:
    mesh&amp;: follower
    target: iterator
    null_action: fade
    time: 1
    sticky: 0

iterator = Shifted:
    mesh: iterator
    delta: {0, 1, 0}

play += Transform:
    mesh&amp;: follower
    target: iterator
    null_action: fade
    time: 1
    sticky: 0
</code></pre>
<video controls>
    Good iterator follower example
    <source src="/video/it_follow_good.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

<p>The key things to note is that the follower <strong>only</strong> for animations, and its values are never read or written to anywhere else. The iterator is <strong>only</strong> used for calculating the different states, and it will never be shown or animated directly.</p>
<p>We highly encourage you structure your Monocurl works in this fashion. It doesn't necessarily have to be in this exact form, but separating the calculation variables and the screen variables is a must in delayed execution.</p>
<h2>5.3 More Examples</h2>

<p>Note that we're doing the same action a lot, so in situations like these the typical approach is to define a helper functor for animations. The above code can be simplified to:</p>

<p>Still more than I'd like, but much more manageable.</p>
<p>Here's one that uses a loop. Functors might make this seem complex but the logic is actually not that bad. Try to think about the timelines for each individual object and do the iterator follower paradigm on that (in this case, the rectangles and the label). Also, note that it is perfectly okay to elide the IF pattern for static images, which are especially common in simpler scenes.</p>

<h2>5.4 Remarks and Conclusion</h2>
<p>Make sure you understand the problem, and why the IF paradigm solves it.</p>
<p>Separating screen and calculation variables is of extreme importance. It might take a little while to get used to, but afterwards it becomes natural. </p>
<p>Remarks: IF might seem redundant to have two variables, but I actually think in complex scenes it's helpful and provides a better sense of identity. Moreover, even though it feels verbose (and definitely is), I think this is something that can be fixed with a language feature pretty easily and is not that bad for complex scenes. Feel free to use more than one iterator variable when you need to. Also, do note that for simple scenes you can get away with just using a follower, but be careful when doing so.</p>
<p>Final Remark: I am considering the possibility of enforcing the IF model by making it a runtime error to read from a screen variable in the initialization phase. However, this is not finalized.</p>
<h2>5.5 (Optional) Pitfalls</h2>
<p>A bit scrappily written, but anyways:</p>
<p>While this model is nice, there is one particular case which is a bit hard to deal with. In particular, when we have state transitions and associated animations that are so complex that they essentially need to be done together. A naive appplication of IF would generally lead to recalculating the thing twice. In terms of solutions, I'm thinking to either take in the iterator as reference, or possibly have the transition return both the iterator and the animation. Not sure which approach is best, but something along those lines is generally the usual solution.</p><div id="next-lessons"><a href="/learn/4_Examples_of_Animations"> Previous Lesson </a><a href="/learn/6_Interpolation_Animations"> Next Lesson </a></div></div><div class="sub-sections"><h1> Sections </h1><a id="label-0" href="#section-0" class="active">5.1 The problem</a><a id="label-1" href="#section-1" class="">5.2 The solution</a><a id="label-2" href="#section-2" class="">5.3 More Examples</a><a id="label-3" href="#section-3" class="">5.4 Remarks and Conclusion</a><a id="label-4" href="#section-4" class="">5.5 (Optional) Pitfalls</a></div>
