<p>[Introductory Logo]</p>
<p>monocurl is a video editor and takes from manim. We also note that it is capable of making slideshows. Monocurl videos are made using the Monocurl Scripting language, which is a relatively simple language.</p>
<h2>0.1 Mathematical Perspective of Animations</h2>
<p>An animation is nothing more than a mapping from t to the points.
Moreover, we can even express everything as an interpolation between some values. In particular, we'll explore how monocurl is all about how transformations on subsets. </p>
<p>Monocurl is all about interpolation and functions.</p>
<h2>0.2 Video Editor Perspective of Programming</h2>
<p>Finally, we think about how is it like an editor. This is the monocurl editor. 
We have a list of slides, which specifies the animations. The behavior is that we specify animations in each slide, and watch the result. This is great because we get a live preview of our works.</p>
<h2>0.3 Conclusions</h2>
<p>Now that we have a we have a very rough idea of monocurl (and don't worry if it is indeed rough! we'll fill in th details later), we'll first get you setup with the basics of the scripting language. Then we'll cover meshes, and spend a while on animations, and finish up with. The idea of Monocurl is very simple, however there are important details and perspectives so you are recommended to read the first few sections with care.</p></div>
