<p>We discussed basics of monocurl animations, but theres still a few things that are awkward. Let me introduce a few problems to illustrate what tags will bring.</p>
<h2>7.1 Problems</h2>
<p>What if we're transforming something and it's not matching the way we want?</p>
<p>What if we want to apply an operation to only some values of the mesh</p>
<p>What if we want to only show a partial or subset of a mesh.</p>
<h2>7.2 Tagging Mechanics</h2>
<p>It turns out, all of these can be solved via tags. A tag is a list of numbers that each mesh keeps track of. The key idea is that this allows us to easily pick subsets, because we can look at a given tag and decide if we want the operation to apply to it or not. This solves problems 2 and 3. The other problem might seem a bit unrelated, but in fact, it's really an issue of identity. Tags also provide identity. There is another Transform, TagTransform, in which the matching algorithm is to match tags of the source to tags of the second. Take a look at the difference</p>
<h2>7.3 Tag Transform Example</h2>
<p>Here are some examples of the resolving issue 1</p>
<h2>7.4 Operation on Tags Example</h2>
<p>And some examples of resolve issue 2. Notice that in general, the way it works is that the selected meshes have the operation apply ot them, and the unselected meshes are returned as is. Note that unselected are still returned though. This allows them to be chained quite easily </p>
<h2>7.5 Animation on Subset Example</h2>
<p>The other use case is to apply animations to only a portion. </p>
<h2>7.6 Conclusion</h2>
<p>Tags are pretty powerful. In general, tags are useful for differentiating different types of meshes, and different instances within classes. For example, this could be used to tag edges and to tag nodes. This is what we mean when we say tagging is identity
Thus tags are very useful in the case that we have complicated mesh-trees with many different meshes.</p>
<p>Congrats, you learned the key principles of monocurl! We'll now cover some tips and tricks.</p></div>
