			<p>
				Monocurl takes inspiration from a variety of existing sources. First and foremost, Monocurl follows very closely from the works of Manim by 3Blue1Brown. In particular, a good amount of animations, meshes, and timing functions are pretty much stolen from ManimGL. On the other side, a crucial component of our work is incorporating the feel of a video editor. This one is slightly harder to attribute to a single piece of software, but iMovie, Final Cut Pro, Adobe After Effects and others of the likes all had some sort of influence.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Monocurl scripting language is relatively simple, but does take inspiration from C++, Python, and functional programming languages.
			</p>

			<p>
				Monocurl makes use of a number of open source technologies. In particular, we appreciate the maintainers of ffmpeg, latex (Tex Live), plibsys, libtess2, and nanosvg for their work.
			</p>

			<p>
				The initial beta release of Monocurl was written by Manu Bhat.
